## 1st Step
  * At first we'll render only one question with the functionality of changing options and changing state based on that and then changing styles based on that.
  * Our App will store question, options array, selected in the state object array. 
  * App will pass props, handleClick, state to the Main which will pass it to the question component.
  * Separate generic styles on the options and conditional styles in two separate classes so that we can conditionally style based on the selected option.
